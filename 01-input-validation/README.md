# ðŸ”’ Lab 01 â€“ Input Validation and XSS Prevention

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Demonstrate how improper input validation can result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and show how secure coding practices like input sanitization prevent such vulnerabilities.

---

## ðŸ§ª The Vulnerability: Reflected XSS

In `vulnerable_app.py`, the Flask app takes untrusted input from the query string and directly embeds it into the page without any sanitization.

### ðŸ’¥ Exploit Example:
```text
http://localhost:5000/?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
